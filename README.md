# Game Development Glossary
This is the place for a list of fancy-schmancy words that people in the game industry use.

**Churn**\
Churn is a metric that measures the number of users who have stopped playing a game over a certain period. In a free-to-play game, churn is often calculated as the number of users who have not played the game in 28 days. The 28-day period is a widely used benchmark to account for differences in play styles among users and to distinguish between casual and active players. By measuring churn in this way, game developers can get a sense of how many players are no longer playing their game and identify areas for improvement.\


**Retention**\
For your game to be successful, it is essential to have customers who make payments. To achieve this, an audience has to be willing to spend money. Therefore, you need continual user engagement, people who play the game regularly or use the app for a prolonged period. Retention can be used to measure the number of users that come back. It is calculated on a particular day following the initial installation of the app. It displays the number of people who restart the app on the Nth day after installation.
